# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-PROJECT
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION PROJECT IN R

INTRODUCTION

The credit card fraud detection project uses machine learning and R programming concepts.
The aim of this project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions using a variety of machine learning algorithms that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent ones.
In this R Project, we will learn how to perform detection of credit cards. We will go through the various algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and finally, Gradient Boosting Classifier. For carrying out the credit card fraud detection, we will make use of the Card Transactions dataset that contains a mix of fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions.

Machine Learning Project – How to Detect Credit Card Fraud

The aim of this R project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. We will use a variety of machine learning algorithms that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent one. By the end of this machine learning project, you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms to perform classification.


SUMMARY

Concluding our R Data Science project, we learnt how to develop our credit card fraud detection model using machine learning. We used a variety of ML algorithms to implement this model and also plotted the respective performance curves for the models. We learnt how data can be analyzed and visualized to discern fraudulent transactions from other types of data.
